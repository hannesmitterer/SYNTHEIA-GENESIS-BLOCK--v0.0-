Model Context Protocol (MCP)
The MCP is an open standard that defines how applications share context with large language models (LLMs). MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools, enabling them to work together more effectively.

You can use MCP to extend the capabilities of Copilot coding agent by connecting it to other tools and services. Learn how to write your JSON MCP configuration
